4. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Autocomplete Term)
       Approach: My first was to create a String query and an Int long weight.
       then for the Term String query it was to see if query had no values which
       gave error. If it didn't give an error it would itiliaze query and set the weight 
       to 0. The next thing that I did was check to see if query and weight are null. If 
       both are given and then itiliaze them. To string just makes the weight and query return 
       Then in the CompareTo it would compare the other.query to query.Then in Reverseweight order
       it would reverse the weight by comparing v and w. In prefix Order it creates a new prefix
       order with the prefix length and then it sorts the term v and w.  

       Issues and resolution: My issue arose with the Term keyword and I had
       to use google to find the answer. I also struggled to understand compare &
       compareTo methods in the problem. I found the videos from FreecodeAcademy and
       GeeksforGeeks helpful in that regard. 

   Problem 2 (Binary Search Deluxe)
       Approach: The first I did was create if a, key or comparator is null or a has no elements in it
       either throw an error or return -1. Then I created a low and high variable 
       then a while loop to go through the elements. I could have done it with a for loop but die to low
       and high changing depending if the key and array are less than it either adds -1 or +1 to mid.
       then it returns mid once done. If it can't enter the loop it ruturns a -1. Then I made it do the same
       thing but in reverse to find the last key rather than first. 

       Issues and resolution: Looked up what comparator is. But other than that it fairly simple. I had trouble
       when submiting it when the length of the array was less than 0 and I sat there for 30 mins
       trying to figure out to do. 

   Problem 3 (Autocomplete)
       Approach: What I did first is set if a null value is passed through terms it would throw an erorr. If it
       didn't it would itilaze the variable creating this.terms and making a copy of it then sorting it lexicographically.
       If the prefix is null then throw error. Then if prefix is not null create a new Term prefix. create an int first index and
       use the binarysearchdelux to find the first term of. Then create a n variable  that keeps track when it matches and stores it 
       in a int variable matches. Then sorts and reverses the order of the matches array and returns it as matches. The NumberofMatches 
       makes it so int i and int j returns j - i + 1 as the number of matches found. If no matches could be found return 0;  

       Issues and resolution: The only issue I had was figuring out when and how to Use BinarySerachDeluxe and how to incoporate in my code.
       Other than that it was fairly simple it just took me a long time.  But, the instructions for the code made it fairly straight forward  
   
5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   The project was much easier than the other ones and the instructions where more striaght forward. There where
   issues relating to different cases which I couldn't figure how to fix. The style checker error makes no sense to me
   and every time I tried to find a solution it would be for eclipse and not VS code which is what I use. The error for die
   in whcih for some reason it can't calculate properly is also worrisome and I have no Idea how to fix it as well as location.
